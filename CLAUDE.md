## Latest Updates

> **Note**: For comprehensive recent updates and bug fixes, see [CLAUDE-RECENT.md](./CLAUDE-RECENT.md)

### January 2025 Phase 1 Implementation:

## Project Impact

Phase 1 positions StackMatch as the industry's first AI-powered RFQ creation platform, solving the immediate pain point of complex software procurement documentation. By focusing on single-player utility before marketplace features, we're building trust and adoption while gathering valuable data for Phase 2/3 optimization.

Key Phase 1 differentiators:
- **AI-First RFQ Creation**: Industry's first TurboTax-style RFQ workflow
- **Immediate Value**: Users get value without waiting for marketplace liquidity
- **Vendor Research**: Comprehensive vendor profiles without commitment
- **Software Cost Control**: Tech stack management saves money today

The phased approach de-risks the platform launch while building a loyal user base that will drive marketplace adoption in Phase 2.
